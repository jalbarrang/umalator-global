Torena Sim is a race and skill simulation toolkit for **Uma Musume: Pretty Derby** Global server.
It helps players, theorycrafters, and tool builders test race behavior with repeatable simulations instead
of relying only on in-game trial runs.

## Project Context

This repository combines:

- A web app for configuring race scenarios and visualizing outputs.
- A simulation engine for speed, acceleration, stamina, and skill activation behavior.
- Data tooling and scripts for extracting, syncing, and validating skill and course data.

The goal is to provide a practical environment for understanding how different builds and race conditions
affect performance.

## What It Is Used For

Use this project when you want to:

- Compare skill loadouts under the same race setup.
- Evaluate skill activation consistency and expected value.
- Inspect velocity and distance trends across many simulation runs.
- Iterate on runner stats, strategy, and conditions before testing in-game.
- Debug or experiment with simulation logic through local scripts.

## Quick Start

### Install and Run

```bash
bun install
bun run dev
```

Open the local URL printed by Vite to use the simulator UI.

### Sync Game Data

```bash
bun run db:fetch        # 1. Download latest master.mdb to ./db
bun run extract:all     # 2. Extract course geometry from master.mdb
bun run sync:data       # 3. Sync entity catalog (skills, umas, cards) from GameTora
```

Start with `master.mdb` to establish what's live on Global, then sync GameTora to overlay the full catalog (including upcoming content). `sync:data` only re-fetches data that changed since the last sync.

See [docs/data-extraction/data-pipeline.md](docs/data-extraction/data-pipeline.md) for details.

## Deployment

Production deploys run automatically on every push to `main` (rolling releases). GitHub Releases from [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) are for changelog/tags only and do not trigger deploys.

The canonical app is hosted on **Cloudflare Pages**. GitHub Pages and Netlify are kept only as 301 redirects to the canonical domain so legacy inbound links don't break.

| Target               | Role        | Workflow                                | URL                                |
| -------------------- | ----------- | --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Cloudflare Pages** | Canonical   | `.github/workflows/deploy-cloudflare.yml` | https://torena-sim.pages.dev       |
| **GitHub Pages**     | 301 redirect | `.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml`    | Configured in repo Pages settings  |
| **Netlify**          | 301 redirect | `.github/workflows/deploy-netlify.yml`  | https://sundays-shadow.netlify.app |

Only Cloudflare Pages runs the full build (incl. the Rust/wasm engine). The two redirect workflows publish a tiny static redirect and do not build the app. All workflows can also be triggered manually via `workflow_dispatch`.

### Versioning

Releases are driven by [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) on `main` (enforced locally via commitlint). [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) tags the **deployed commit** and opens a GitHub Release — there is no `chore(release)` commit on `main`.

- **`__APP__VERSION__`**: latest `v*` tag semver + current short commit hash (e.g. `0.13.0+6f1340a`)
- **In-app changelog**: `CHANGELOG.md` is regenerated during deploy builds (`bun run changelog:generate`); locally run that after `git fetch --tags` to refresh the modal in dev
- **GitHub Releases**: release notes for Discord / announcements

```bash
# Preview the next version and release notes
GITHUB_TOKEN=<pat> bun run release:dry-run

# Tag current commit and create GitHub Release
GITHUB_TOKEN=<pat> bun run release
```

Use `DATA_UPDATE_PAT` as `GITHUB_TOKEN` for local releases.
