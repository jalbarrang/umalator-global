# Umalator Global

## Package Management

- Prefer using `bun` for package management, avoid using `npm`/`yarn`/`pnpm`.
- Prefer using the available `package.json` scripts instead of running commands directly for typechecking, linting, formatting, testing, etc.

## Code Style

- Never create barrel files, always use named exports.

## React Patterns

- This project uses Base UI patterns, not older Radix-style composition.
- Do not assume local wrapper components support `asChild`.
- Before using common shadcn or Radix idioms, check the local wrapper API first.
- Prefer the repo's existing `render={...}` composition patterns when working with triggers and buttons.
- Destructure props inside the component body, not in the function signature.
- use `type` instead of `interface` for component props.
- Don't overuse `useEffect` for simple state updates.
- Don't use deprecated `forwardRef` for component refs, pass the `ref` as a prop.
- This project should follow the React 19+ composition patterns.
- This project doesn't use React Server Components.

## Agent Skills

### Issue Tracker

For tracking issues and work items we use `Beads` see `docs/dev-process/issue-tracker.md`

<!-- BEGIN BEADS INTEGRATION v:1 profile:minimal hash:ca08a54f -->
## Beads Issue Tracker

This project uses **bd (beads)** for issue tracking. Run `bd prime` to see full workflow context and commands.

### Quick Reference

```bash
bd ready              # Find available work
bd show <id>          # View issue details
bd update <id> --claim  # Claim work
bd close <id>         # Complete work
```

### Rules

- Use `bd` for ALL task tracking — do NOT use TodoWrite, TaskCreate, or markdown TODO lists
- Run `bd prime` for detailed command reference and session close protocol
- Use `bd remember` for persistent knowledge — do NOT use MEMORY.md files

## Session Completion

**When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:
   ```bash
   git pull --rebase
   bd dolt push
   git push
   git status  # MUST show "up to date with origin"
   ```
5. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches
6. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed
7. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds
- NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally
- NEVER say "ready to push when you are" - YOU must push
- If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds
