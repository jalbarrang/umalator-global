//! # uma-sim-vacuum
//!
//! The **synthetic / vacuum** race engine (ADR-0005). Typically one runner; the
//! absent field is *synthesized* (artificial [`DuelingRates`]) and
//! field-dependent skill conditions are *approximated*. This crate owns:
//!
//! - the [`Race`](race::Race) aggregate: a single-/small-field loop that
//!   **produces `FieldInputs` from approximate condition values + synthetic
//!   rates** (no live contention coordinator), then calls the shared pure step
//!   in `uma-sim-primitives`;
//! - the [`run_compare`](simulation::run_compare) use case + paired-delta
//!   orchestration;
//! - the [`CompareDataCollector`](collectors::CompareDataCollector) read-model.
//!
//! It contains **no paradigm flag** — there is no contested branch; the
//! contested bench lives in `uma-sim-race`. Both engines run the same step
//! kernel and differ only in how they produce `FieldInputs`.
//!
//! [`DuelingRates`]: uma_sim_primitives::runner::mechanics::DuelingRates
