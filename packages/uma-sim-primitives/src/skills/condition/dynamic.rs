//! Runtime (dynamic) condition predicate + the live-race view trait it observes.
//!
//! In the TypeScript engine a dynamic condition is `(runner: Runner) => boolean`
//! evaluated each tick. Here it is a boxed closure over the [`RunnerView`] trait,
//! which is the anti-corruption seam: the skills context observes live race state
//! without depending on the `racing` module. `RunnerView` is intentionally empty
//! for now and is fleshed out by the full-sim condition work (t-009).
