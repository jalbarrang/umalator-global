//! # Runner entity
//!
//! The `Runner` is the core **entity** within the `Race` aggregate (identity =
//! `RunnerId`, mutable per-round lifecycle). Its behavior is split across
//! submodules for readability: lifecycle/init, physics, skills, and the game
//! mechanics (rushed/dueling/spot-struggle/downhill/last-spurt).
//!
//! ## Skeleton status
//!
//! The struct below is the **entity skeleton**: it currently carries the
//! identity, kinematic, and position-keep fields needed by the position-keep /
//! pacing domain services (t-011). The remaining fields (full skill state,
//! rushed/dueling/spot-struggle/downhill mechanics, the per-stream RNGs, etc.)
//! and the construction / lifecycle reset are added by t-013..t-016. New fields
//! are additive — they do not invalidate the position-keep behavior defined here.
