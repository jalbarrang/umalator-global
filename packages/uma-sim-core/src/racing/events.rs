//! Lifecycle **domain events** and the [`RaceObserver`] port the aggregate emits
//! to.
//!
//! Port of `common/race-events.ts` (the `RaceEventBus` + `subscribeObserver`).
//! The `Race` aggregate (t-017) owns a [`RaceObservers`] dispatcher and emits at
//! each lifecycle point; read-model projection collectors (t-018) and the WASM
//! bridge implement [`RaceObserver`].
//!
//! Observers read live state through the [`RaceObservation`] / [`RunnerObservation`]
//! read-only view traits, which the aggregate and its runners implement. This is
//! the projection seam: this file defines only the lifecycle port + minimal
//! scalar payloads. The richer telemetry record (`race-event-log.ts`) is derived
//! by a projection in the application layer (t-018), not emitted here.
