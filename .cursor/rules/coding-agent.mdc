## Code Agents

### Code Generation

- Prefer direct imports from specific files rather than aggregating exports through index files.
- Be sure to run typechecks and the linter after writing code to ensure the code implemented is correct.

### Refactoring

- Refactors need to be thoughful while having context of the overall codebase and proposed changes.
- When refactoring never create backwards compatibility or fallback logic unless instructed to do so, even if we're doing breaking changes.
- Think out of the box when suggesting code changes.

### Documentation

Never write Markdown files for documentation unless instructed do so.

Always use the code comments as the proper documentation, code should speak for itself.

In the same way, ensure a TTD approach to write and implement code, tests should also be a way of documenting the code, don't go overboard with tests, we're not aiming for 100% coverage, but we want to be confident in the code we write.

When asked to write documentation in markdown files, always create them under the `docs` folder.

### Reviewing generated code

- [ ] Run `npm run typecheck` to ensure the code is type-safe.
- [ ] Run `npm run lint` to ensure the code is linted.
