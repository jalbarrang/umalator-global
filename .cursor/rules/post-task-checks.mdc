# Post-Task Quality Checks

After completing any implementation tasks, you MUST run the following commands to check for code-related issues:

## Required Commands

1. **Type Check**: Run `bun typecheck` to verify TypeScript type correctness
   - This catches type errors, missing types, and type mismatches
   - Fix any type errors before considering the task complete

2. **Linting**: Run `bun lint` to check code quality and style
   - This catches code style issues, potential bugs, and best practice violations
   - Fix any linting errors before considering the task complete

## Important

**NEVER** run `bun dev` or `bun build` - the user will handle these commands themselves.

## Workflow

1. Complete the implementation
2. Run `bun typecheck` and address any type errors
3. Run `bun lint` and fix any linting issues
4. Verify both commands pass successfully
5. Only then consider the task complete

These checks ensure code quality and catch issues early before they become problems.
