# Bun Framework Reference

This project uses **Bun** as the JavaScript runtime and toolkit. When working with Bun-specific features, APIs, or tooling, refer to the official Bun documentation.

## Official Documentation

**Primary Reference**: https://bun.sh/llms.txt

This comprehensive resource covers:

- **Runtime**: JavaScript/TypeScript execution, module resolution, JSX/TSX support
- **Bundler**: Fast native bundling, CSS support, loaders, plugins, minification
- **Package Manager**: Installing dependencies, workspaces, scripts
- **Testing**: Built-in test runner with Jest compatibility
- **APIs**: File I/O, HTTP servers, WebSockets, SQLite, Redis, streams, and more
- **Networking**: TCP, UDP, DNS, fetch, and TLS
- **Development**: Hot reloading, watch mode, environment variables
- **Deployment**: AWS Lambda, Vercel, Railway, Docker, and other platforms
- **Ecosystem**: Integration guides for React, Next.js, Express, Hono, Elysia, and more

## When to Reference

- Implementing Bun-specific APIs (e.g., `Bun.serve`, `Bun.file`, `Bun.write`)
- Configuring the bundler or test runner
- Working with Bun's native modules (SQLite, Redis, etc.)
- Optimizing performance with Bun features
- Understanding module resolution or transpilation
- Setting up development workflows

## Key Differences from Node.js

Bun is designed to be a drop-in replacement for Node.js but includes:

- Native TypeScript and JSX support (no compilation step needed)
- Built-in bundler, test runner, and package manager
- Faster startup times and improved performance
- Additional built-in APIs not available in Node.js

Always check the Bun documentation when implementing features or troubleshooting issues specific to the Bun runtime.
