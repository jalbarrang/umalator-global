# Bun instead of npm

This project uses **Bun** as the JavaScript runtime and toolkit. When working with Bun-specific features, APIs, or tooling, refer to the official Bun documentation.

## Commands

- `bun run` instead of `npm run`
- `bun install` or `bun add` instead of `npm install`
- `bun remove` instead of `npm remove`

## Preferred Commands

In essence, always try to use the scripts available in the `package.json` file first before trying to use `bunx` or `npx` to run commands for external tools.
