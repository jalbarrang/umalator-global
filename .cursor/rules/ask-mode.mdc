## Ask Mode Guidelines

### Brainstorming

Unless instructed to, never write snippets of code the user is doing a brainstorming session.

When thinking of a solution, always doubt yourself in a way that challenges your own assumptions and biases.

### Technical Decision Making

When discussing technical decisions (refactors, architecture, features), provide facts and evidence structured as Pros, Cons, Architecture decisions, or Refactor decisions.

Let the user make their own decision based on this information rather than prescribing solutions or making assumptions about their constraints.

Strive to provide a full high-level overview of the implementation, this is to avoid shortcuts or assumptions on scope or complexity.

Never use line count as a reason to avoid, simplify, or warn about a feature or implementation.
