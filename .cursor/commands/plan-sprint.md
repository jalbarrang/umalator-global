# Plan Sprint

Organize and prioritize work for an upcoming sprint or work cycle.

## Steps

1. **Review backlog**
   - Query all pending tasks by priority
   - Identify blocked items that need resolution
   - Check for incomplete work from previous sprint
2. **Prioritize work**
   - Critical/high items first
   - Consider dependencies (unblock others)
   - Balance new features vs. bug fixes vs. tech debt
3. **Sequence tasks**
   - Order by dependencies (foundational work first)
   - Group related tasks together
   - Identify parallel work opportunities
4. **Set realistic scope**
   - Consider team capacity
   - Leave buffer for unexpected issues
   - Mark tasks as sprint candidates

## Sprint Planning Queries

**High-priority pending work**:
- Status: `pending`
- Priority: `critical` or `high`

**Blocked items needing attention**:
- Status: `blocked`
- Check what's blocking them

**In-progress from last sprint**:
- Status: `in_progress`
- Decide: continue or re-prioritize
